# FIFA Rating Predictor/DB

## Overview
In preparation for the the release of EAFC 24, I wanted to attempt to predict the ratings of some of the top players in the world. By using historical FIFA data alongside real-life stats, I attempted to accurately predict ratings of players.

## Process
* Data was scraped from futbin.com and understat.com using BeautifulSoup
* The data was then combined by matching clubs and player names manually and via fuzzy-matching
* Cleaned data was then populated into a custom made database to allow for complex queries to match-up different FIFA years with real life seasons
* DB was queried using RPostgres and then analysis was done using R

## Database
Based on the following diagram, the goal is to expand the project to also contain data from teams which may improve the current predictions along with allowing for future projects/analysis (Click on the image for an interactive view)
